# Listening Lab, New Zealand
Multidisciplinary research group developing computational bioacoustic tools for improved conservation results

## About
The research team and activities combine multidisciplinary expertise and methodology to investigate and study SOUND (generation, detection & classification). We are interested in monitoring and labelling natural sounds of Aotearoa-NZ, for which we develop species-customised denoising and classification tools. 

Another strong research pillar of the Listening Lab is HEARING, where we follow open questions related to the human hearing process to develop improved sound detection devices (microphones, hearing aids, cochlear implants) to help people with impaired hearing or hearing loss.
